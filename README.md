# Exploring Machine Learning Algorithms for Effective Analysis of Software Defect Prediction System

This repository contains the code and documentation for a Software Defect Prediction (SDP) system using the NASA Software Metrics dataset from Kaggle. The system aims to predict software defects using machine learning techniques, leveraging various features such as code complexity, size, and change history.

1) Data Collection
The dataset is imported from Kaggle, containing software metrics related to various software modules.

2. Data Preprocessing
Preprocessing ensures the dataset is suitable for machine learning models:

3) Importing the Data: NASA dataset with software quality measures.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations (histograms, box plots, scatter matrices) are used to identify patterns, correlations, and outliers.

4) Handling Missing Values: Missing values are either estimated or excluded based on their frequency and impact.
Outlier Detection: Outliers are treated to prevent bias in model training.

5) Handling Categorical Variables: Categorical variables are encoded using techniques like One-Hot Encoding or Label Encoding.

6) . Feature Engineering and Selection
Irrelevant or duplicate features are removed to improve model performance.
Relevant features are selected using feature selection algorithms to enhance accuracy and reduce complexity.

7). Feature Scaling
StandardScaler from scikit-learn is used to normalize features by removing the mean and scaling them to unit variance.
